# The Scarborough Survey
This is the repository of the Scarborough survey, created by the [Suburban Mobilities Cluster at UTSC] (https://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/suburban-mobilities/).

## Background

While urban regions continue to grow, much of the urbanization that is occurring is better described as suburbanization. This is generating and will continue to generate immense pressure on our social and environmental systems. To address these challenges and exploit specific suburban opportunities, cities globally require a complete understanding of the complexity of how human and environmental systems are uniquely intertwined within suburban contexts. The [Suburban Mobilities (SuMo) cluster at the University of Toronto Scarborough (UTSC)] (https://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/suburban-mobilities/) aims to address these academic and policy challenges, generating transformative, interdisciplinary, partnered research about suburban contexts that will allow communities to solve holistic transportation challenges facing the suburbanized world in the 21st century.

Among the multiple projects developed within the SuMo cluster, one highlight is the design of a survey that allows obtaining multidimensional data on suburban contexts. Multiple data sources have allowed us to characterize the Scarborough area to date: transport networks and trip diaries, locations of amenities, census data, pricing, and land value information, among others. Considering these existing sources, we wondered what information would be helpful to collect in a survey to fill data gaps that would allow a better and deeper characterization of transportationâ€™s impacts on quality of life of people living in Scarborough.

The interdisciplinary Suburban Mobilities cluster includes investigators from 5 different departments: Geography & Planning, Sociology, Health & Society, Political Science, and Management. Based on this expertise, we designed a survey with six different modules using transportation and equity as a cross-cutting theme, including the role of the COVID-19 pandemic in exacerbating existing barriers and inequalities.

each respondent answered a core section (mobility and built environment, core survey, sociodemographic and ending questions). The core survey includes two to three key questions about health, social capital and values.

## What does this repository contain?

In the Confidentiality and Privacy subsection of our Ethics Research Protocol (REB), we stated that a smaller set of the data that removes all potentially identifying participant data will be made publicly available. 
This dataset does not contain addresses but retain the first three digits of postal codes to enable aggregated geographical analysis.

The anonymized subset of data for the core section is available on this repository free of use, alongside a data dictionary for easier use. 
If any person wants to have access to the full dataset, the corresponding author, Ignacio Tiznado-Aitken, can provide further information regarding authorship policy and ongoing research projects using the survey to avoid potential overlaps.

### REB and Authorship Policy Acknowledgment Form
After reading the previous two documents, please sign the form and send it to me. Every faculty/student aiming to receive a research grant must have this document signed.

### Data dictionary
This file contains all questions, sections, codes, and notes to understand it the best way possible

### Survey data
This file contains the answers from 1850 Scarboorugh residents. Sections 2 (mobility and built environment), Section 3 (core module) and Section 9 (sociodemographic module).
The survey design reduced sample (1 to 5):  Each reduced sample version contains the three previous modules (Sections 2, 3 and 9) 
Additional data can be accessed upon request. This data includes one of these five sections: Section 4 (Older adults and active transport), Section 5 (Health), Section 6 (Social capital), Section 7 (Political values) and Section 8 (Automobility).

### Descriptive figures
The repository includes a folder with simple graphs to visualize aggregated results by question.
